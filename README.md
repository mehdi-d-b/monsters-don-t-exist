# MONSTERS DON'T EXIST

## Author: Mehdi B.

### Description
Jordane, a journalist who works for a paranormal magazine, receives a letter from a stranger asking her to investigate her hometown, Duli, which is said to harbor monsters. 
Skeptical but in dire need of a subject for her next article, she decides to explore the desolate alleys of this mysterious town, accompanied by her best friend Raphaël, a professional hacker by day and amateur investigator by night. 
At first glance, Duli is a dead town, traumatized by disasters and accidents with mysterious circumstances, but on closer inspection, didn't all these events happen for a reason? And moreover, why does this town seem to grip them to the core as if it knew their darkest secrets? 
Could it be that monsters really do exist?
